                            My experience at the Mangal Anand Hospital was extremely positive. Met Dr. Mangal Parihar after two failed surgeries of the right arm. The doctors explanation of what he would be doing to join my fractured bone was most convincing and made me feel that at last I had come to the doctor who would surely heal the fracture. Doctor was most patient and positive in his explanation. Dr. Parihar went into every detail eg. I had a wrist drop after the second surgery, hence doctor took extra care to have a nerve mapping test done a day before the surgery and luckily I have the complete movement of my right wrist and fingers. The surgery was done on the 4th of August, at his Hospital great care was taken of me by all the Staff. Would also like to mention Dr. Divya Ahuja who has been most patient, understanding and supporting, before, during my stay in hospital and even post operative on my Visits and on the telephone. I would recommend everyone in trouble to consult Dr. Mangal Parihar. Lastly a very big thank you to both the doctors for all the care and effort to make me well again.

                            I have been fortunate, rather blessed because I have met Dr. Mangal and Dr. Divya. Thanks is the smallest word I can say to Dr. Mangal & Dr. Divya as well. Mangal Anand Hospital is not only the centre for Reconstruction but it gives you Reconstruction of New Life. I have recommended to some of patients i know and they have also benefited by Dr. Mangal.

                            When I look back at the condition I was in when I first came to Mangal Parihar hospital, the journey is unbelievable. Owing to an ankle fracture followed by a host of failed fusion surgeries by "experts" in the field, I could barely walk due to the intensity of pain. Today I am pain-free and mobile, and this is nothing short of a miracle. And as I have discovered in conversations with a multitude of other patients over these months, there are many, many stories such as mine. I thank both Dr Mangal Parihar and Dr Divya Ahuja for this fresh start.

                            I met with a major road accident and I got a new life after taking treatment from Mangal Anand hospital. All Doctors are professional, super and very friendly and you feel homely atmosphere. Even staff are very cooperative, friendly and helpful. Cost wise also reasonable compared to other hospitals. Whoever comes to this hospital will get a new life. This I am saying because of my personal experience. In my case other hospital did not give any hope for my survival as I was bed ridden for almost one year but Dr. Mangal and Dr. Divya gave their 100% and today I am walking without the stick and they gifted me a beautiful life to enjoy with my family members.

                            Dr. Mangal & his Team of doctors are well experienced. They are not only able to understand the core issues one is facing but also how to resolve it with minimum treatment.
                            Very cordial and helpful staff. As our 6 year son Jaden underwent ankle deformity correction surgery, one can imagine how challenging it is to handle kids post surgery but with the doctors and staff proactive approach it was a smooth transition. Our son is recovering well and soon will to able to run also.
