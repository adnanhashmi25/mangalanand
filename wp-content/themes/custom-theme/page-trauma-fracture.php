                            Trauma is defined as a sudden incident causing physical injury. It is a broad term describing all types of injuries affecting the muscles, tendons, ligaments, joints, nerves, blood vessels, or bones that most commonly occur during sports, exercise, or any other physical activity. Trauma may be a result of accidents, poor training practices, insufficient warm-up and stretching exercises, or from use of improper gear. The term is wide-ranging and may include sprains, strains, minor fractures, dislocations, or serious broken bones with a direct threat to the patientâ€™s life.

                                <li><b>Open reduction and internal fixation:</b> In this approach, an incision is made over the fractured bone to expose the fracture. The fragments of bone are realigned and stabilized with metal wires, screws, pins, and plates. The incision is closed and dressed, and the affected bone is placed in a splint, shoe, boot, or cast to promote healing.</li>
                                <li><b>Percutaneous screw fixation:</b>For some types of fractures, reduction can be achieved with a closed manipulation of the affected bone using X-ray. The bone can either be pushed or pulled to set it into place without making a large incision. This method, called percutaneous fracture fixation, can be performed with one or more small incisions instead of the traditional large incision, through which the implants are fixed.</li>
                                <li><b>Arthroscopy:</b>This is a minimally invasive surgery where a flexible fiberoptic tube with a high-intensity light and camera attached at the end, called an arthroscope, is used to view the affected joint and guide miniature instruments to remove fragments of torn ligament, bone, or cartilage from within the joint.</li>
                                <li><b>Reconstruction:</b>Torn ligaments can be surgically repaired with sutures or replaced with a graft, which can be another ligament and/or tendon retrieved from another part of the body.</li>
                                <li><b>Fusion:</b> In cases of severe injury, damaged bones are fused together so that they heal into one single bone. This limits movement in the joint.</li>

                            A fracture is a medical condition in which a bone is cracked or broken. It is a break in the continuity of the bone. While many fractures are the result of high-force impact or stress, bone fractures can also occur because of certain medical conditions that weaken the bones, such as osteoporosis.

                            A fracture may be complete or partial and is commonly caused by trauma due to a fall, motor vehicle accident or sports injury. Thinning of the bone due to osteoporosis in the elderly can also cause bones to break easily. Overuse injuries are a common cause of stress fractures in athletes.

                            Our body reacts to a fracture by protecting the injured area with a blood clot and callus or fibrous tissue. Bone cells begin forming on either side of the fracture line. These cells grow towards each other and eventually close the fracture.

                            The objective of early fracture management is to control bleeding, prevent ischemic injury (bone death) and to remove sources of infection such as foreign bodies and dead tissues. The next step is the reduction of the fracture and its maintenance. It is important to ensure that the involved part of the body returns to its function after the fracture heals. To achieve this, fracture reduction and immobilization are achieved by either a non-operative or surgical method.

                            This is done for any fracture that is displaced, shortened, or angulated. Splints and casts are made of fiberglass or Plaster of Paris (POP) and are used to immobilize the limb.

                            Skin traction involves attachment of traction tapes to the skin of the limb segment below the fracture. In skeletal traction, a pin is inserted through the bone and attached to ropes. Weights are applied, and the patient is placed in a traction apparatus. This method is commonly used for fractures of long bones.
