                    <b>X-ray</b> <br>
                    An X-ray uses high-frequency radiations to produce images of the inside of your body. Detailed, real-time X-rays images are produced for the diagnosis of a wide range of conditions such as fractures, infections, tumours, arthritis in joints, bone loss and dental issues.

                    <b>Ultrasound</b><br>
                    Diagnostic ultrasound scans are also known as sonography. It is a procedure that captures live images of your internal organs using high-frequency sound waves. Ultrasound scans are used to study detailed investigations of a personâ€™s abdomen, pelvic organs, muscles, tendons and heart vessels.
